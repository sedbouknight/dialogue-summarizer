# dialogue-summarizer
 Completed dialogue summarization task using Generative AI. Utilized FLAN-T5 Large Language Model using Hugging Face Transformers and experimented with zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot inference. Performed PEFT fine-tuning to improve inferences and used ROUGE metrics to evaluate results. Also used reinforcement learning to generate more positive summaries.
